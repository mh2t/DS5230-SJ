Association mining, also known as market basket analysis, is a data mining technique used to discover interesting patterns or associations among a large set of items or transactions. It is commonly used in the retail industry to identify which products are frequently purchased together, as well as to identify cross-selling and up-selling opportunities.

The goal of association mining is to find itemsets that occur together more frequently than would be expected by chance. This is typically done by calculating two measures: support and confidence. Support measures the frequency of an itemset in the dataset, while confidence measures the strength of the association between two items in an itemset.

Association mining algorithms typically use the Apriori algorithm, which generates candidate itemsets and prunes them based on their support levels. Other algorithms, such as FP-Growth and Eclat, have also been developed to improve the efficiency of Apriori by using different data structures and algorithms.

Association mining has various applications in addition to market basket analysis, such as identifying patterns in healthcare data, web clickstream data, and social network data. However, it does have limitations, such as the inability to handle numerical data and the generation of large numbers of redundant rules. These limitations can be overcome through the use of other data mining techniques or by preprocessing the data appropriately.
