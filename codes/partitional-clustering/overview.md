Partitional clustering is a method of clustering data in which a fixed number of clusters is determined beforehand, and the goal is to partition the data into these pre-determined clusters. The most popular method for this is the k-means algorithm.
The k-means algorithm starts by initializing k cluster centroids, and then repeatedly assigns each data point to the cluster whose centroid is closest, and then updates the cluster centroids based on the data points assigned to it.
