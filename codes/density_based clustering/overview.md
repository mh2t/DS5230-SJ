**DBSCAN** (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) is a popular clustering algorithm that is used for identifying dense regions of points in a dataset and grouping them into clusters. Unlike other clustering algorithms that require the number of clusters to be specified in advance, DBSCAN does not require the number of clusters to be specified and can discover an arbitrary number of clusters.

<p align="justify">
The algorithm works by defining a neighborhood around each data point and grouping together points that are close to each other. Points that are isolated from the dense regions are treated as noise and are not assigned to any cluster. The two main parameters of the DBSCAN algorithm are the radius eps and the minimum number of points min_samples required to form a dense region. Points that have at least min_samples points within a distance of eps are considered to be in the same dense region and are grouped into the same cluster.

<p align="justify">
DBSCAN is a density-based algorithm, meaning it can discover clusters of arbitrary shapes and can effectively handle datasets with clusters of varying densities. However, it is sensitive to the choice of eps and min_samples parameters and may produce suboptimal results if these parameters are not carefully chosen.

<p align="justify">
Overall, DBSCAN is a useful and versatile clustering algorithm that can be applied to a wide range of datasets and can effectively handle datasets with complex cluster structures.

**Gaussian Mixture Model** (GMM) is a probabilistic model that represents a dataset as a mixture of several Gaussian distributions. GMM is a type of clustering algorithm that is used to partition a dataset into several clusters, where each cluster is represented by a Gaussian distribution.
</p>

<p align="justify">
In GMM, each data point is assigned a probability of belonging to each of the Gaussian distributions, and the sum of these probabilities for each data point must equal 1. The parameters of the Gaussian distributions, such as the mean and covariance, are estimated from the data using an optimization algorithm such as the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm.
</p>

<p align="justify">
GMM can handle datasets with clusters of different shapes and sizes, as well as datasets with overlapping clusters. However, it assumes that the clusters are generated from Gaussian distributions and may not perform well on datasets with non-Gaussian clusters.
